                        Muhammad bin Salman, born in 1985, is a prominent Saudi Arabian royal and politician,
                        known for his ambitious reform agenda and his role as Crown Prince since 2017.
                        <br/><br/>He has spearheaded the Vision 2030 program aimed at diversifying the Saudi
                        economy and modernizing society.
                        <br/><br/>While praised for his efforts, he has also faced criticism for alleged human
                        rights abuses and his involvement in controversial incidents, such as the murder of
                        journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.
                        <br/><br/>Nonetheless, he remains a significant figure both domestically and
                        internationally, shaping Saudi Arabia&apos;s future trajectory and its relations with
                        the global community.
